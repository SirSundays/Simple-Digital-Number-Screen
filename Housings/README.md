In this folder you can find the 3d prints I used and created for this little project.

### Raspberry Pi Zero Case

I found this case on Thingiverse:

I modified it and added a little bridge with a hole so you can mount it at the back of the used monitor at one of the VESA mounting points.
The file is: Rpi-Zero-Case-Clim - Modified

### Controller

The other two files are the controller box. It consist of a box an lid. The lid can be secured but I would advise to add another hole on the other side of the box to secure it with a third screw.
Otherwise there are just holes for all the components.
There is no real specific place for every component inside the box. I just cramped it all in there.
My assembly process:
1.  Put in the battery
1.  Put in the USB Breakout and screw it in place. I added some solder to the solder points beforehand.
1.  Put in the button. Also added some solder there before.
1. Put in the ESP8266 with all the other components already attached.
1.  Soldered all the other components carefully in place. Watch out not to hit the battery with the soldering Iron.
1.  Plugged in the battery last. 
1.  Pushed the lit on. It is easier when the hook up wires are a bit shorter to be honest.

Is this ideal? No! This is just something so you can use it without some bare components in your hands. This can definitly done better.
